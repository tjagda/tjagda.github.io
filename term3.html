                    In my third workterm, I returned to <a href="https://www.cooperators.ca/" target="_blank">The
                        Co-operators</a> to work as an <strong>RPA Developer</strong> at their innovation team.<br />
                    <br /> This innovation team was based in an incubator in Kitchener. The main reason it was in a
                    different location from Head Office was to seperate the team from normal company culture and
                    process of working (<strong>Waterfall</strong>) and experiment a new process of development (<strong>Agile</strong>)
                    to see if this way of working can be more beneficial to the organization.<br />
                    <br />Unlike last time, I was working in an agile team made mostly of other co-ops. Most of the
                    others were from different schools, had different levels of experinces and different skill sets
                    which was great because I get to see the different perspectives they all have. We worked in
                    bi-weekly sprints where we then demo what we have done in the two weeks, do a retrospective, and
                    then do sprint planning for the next week. Overall, I enjoyed working and learning from all of them
                    each and everyday.<br />
                    <br /> In general, and compared my last workterms, I would say that my experience as an RPA
                    developer felt more satisfying, was so much more exciting, and actually gave the sense that I was
                    actually contributing something for the organization.

                                                        From my knowledge last time, I was sure this could be a
                                                        challenge I would face especially since I was working as a
                                                        developer this time around because estimating work effort and
                                                        following through is very difficult in the beginning and can
                                                        only be improved with experience. This term really encapsulated
                                                        that as we struggled a bit with our initial sprints, but by the
                                                        end we improved greatly and our burndown charts were much more
                                                        reasonable and looked pretty nice.

                                                        Even before the workterm started, our manager asked us to look
                                                        into some tools to get a hang of what they're like which made
                                                        starting a bit easier. As sprints came and went and as weworked
                                                        on more processes, we definitely were became very proficient on
                                                        how the tool works, what it can and can't do, and even some
                                                        tricks for it to automate certain things that we initially
                                                        thought weren't possible in a faster and more efficent manner.

                                                        Right from the beginning, I have already started working with
                                                        my teammates with simply setting up our workstations on the
                                                        first day. Since they were other co-ops from a variety of
                                                        schools, it wasn't long before we would have lunches together,
                                                        play card games and talk about what's up. This comradery helped
                                                        out when I struggled with certain problems and decisions when
                                                        working on my project since I can easily and comfortably turn
                                                        around ask for their input or help. This made any blockers
                                                        resolve much quickly than it would if I did not work well with
                                                        the other group members to finish the same problem.

                                    processes have time to focus on more engaging and creative tasks that can benefit
                                    the organization.<br />
                                    <br /> As one of the first RPA developers for this company's new endeavor, my
                                    partner and I were tasked to evaluate and compare the top 3 RPA tools that was
                                    listed in the Forrester Wave report. After deciding which one was the best fit for
                                    The Co-operators to use, we were then tasked to try and implement pre-planned
                                    business processes as a Proof of Concept to see if this RPA tool works and was of
                                    value.<br />
                                    <br /> Our automations specifically helped reduce the work effort greatly when we
                                    started using them for real production work. For example, a process that would
                                    require a full-time employee about an hour and more takes about 10 min with our
                                    automations. And that is not including reducing the errors, frustrations, and
                                    boredom the full-time employee would have had.

                                    My partner and I were assigned processes from 2 different teams in the
                                    organization. One of which was for the Finance team and the other was for the CRM
                                    team (which was the one I was assigned to). The processes I had to work on for the
                                    CRM team typically were about automating work on retrieving, updating, or creating
                                    client information to speed up and lessen the work load for the CRM team.<br />
                                    <br /> The process of creating these automations were not terribly difficult but
                                    they were quite long and required quite a few error-handling procedures like what
                                    to do when the environment or the internet connection is down. The majority of the
                                    automations were initially meant for the work in test environments easier, but
                                    since my partner and I finished some of the processes very quickly and efficiently,
                                    we moved forward to get these automations to run in production environments which
                                    ended up in great success.

                                <p>
                                    After working my third term with The Co-operators now, it's safe to say that I
                                    loved my entire experience here! My previous 2 workterms with The Co-operators as a
                                    QA/Web Developer were very good learning experiences on the enterprise environment,
                                    web development, and general QA work. However, this time around I got to be more
                                    hands-on everyday and doing work that I know will make a difference to the
                                    organization which I found the last workterms lacked. It was also great experience
                                    working in an agile environment in the workplace and applying what I've learned in
                                    class. Overall, I say that this was an over-the-top amazing experience and I would
                                    definitely not mind doing this again in a future co-op.

                                    I first would like to thank Ron Mooibroek for giving me the amazing opportunity to
                                    work with them and the Innovation Team for the Co-operators this summer. I would
                                    also like to thank all my co-workers and colleagues for making my workterm fun and
                                    energetic everyday. Lastly, I would like to acknowledge Katherine McRoberts, Laura
                                    Gatto, and all of the Co-operative Education & Career Services team on making sure
                                    that this workterm would go as smoothly as possible.
