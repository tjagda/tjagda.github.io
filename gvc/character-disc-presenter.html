          <h3>What is discipline?</h3>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Bill Hybels put it into two words:</p>
          <p class="fragment">Delayed Gratification</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p class="verse">
            "The key to practicing discipline can be described in three words -
            advance decision making. You are making an advance decision to delay
            gratification as long as necessary to achieve the results you most
            desire. That's discipline. "
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            In today's culture, there are so many resources, books, videos,
            guides for "quick fixes"
          </p>
          <p class="fragment">
            But you won't find anything on how to build that character in our
            those quick fix roadmaps..
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            "True discipline will be developed only by
            <u>deciding in advance</u> what results you wish to achieve and then
            putting your shoulder to the wheel… and <u>staying the course</u>."
          </p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            In which of these areas have you've pursued a quick-fix approach to
            achieving a desired result, only to be disappointed? And why?
          </p>

          <h3>Scripture</h3>
          <p>Galatians 5:16-26</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            How many of the traits in v19-21 stem from
            instant&nbsp;gratification?
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Why do the qualities in v22-23 require a commitment to delayed
            gratification?
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            What does v25 mean when it says to “live by the Spirit”? (see Romans
            8:3-11 and Galatians 3:1-6)
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Why / how is discipline needed to live by the Spirit?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Application</h3>
          <p>
            Consider “one area” of your life that can benefit from greater
            discipline. What would it mean for you to trust God by allowing His
            Holy Spirit to work in that area?
