              It is designed to help us learn endurance and give us
              encouragement so we can have hope! (Romans 15:4)

              The Bible gives use hope because the "God of hope" recorded it for
              us.
            </p>
            <p>
              When things seem hopeless, God gives hope that serves as a steady
              anchor (Romans 15:13)

              The love of God shows Christians that even troubles work for our

              Even before we turn to God and turn away from doing things that go
              against God's laws (or sin), God already loves us.

              When we love God in return, He can make everything, even the
