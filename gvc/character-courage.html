            The word courage is often associated with soldiers, fire fighters,
            and explorers of the unknown...

            However, courage doesn't mean "fear-less" but actually means
            <u>taking action in the face of fear</u>.

            Sometimes we think courageous people were just born that way…

            However, courageous people are no different than anyone else.
            They're just ordinary people who <u>chose</u> at some point to face
            their fears rather than run from them.

            1. What tactics did Nehemiah's enemies use when attempting to get
            him to stop rebuilding the walls?
          </p>
          <p>What happens when we allow ourselves to be intimidated?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            2. How much of his energy did Nehemiah spend on the threats from his
            opposition and how much did he pour into the task of rebuilding?
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is this kind of focus so important to sustaining courage in the
            face of adversity?
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>

            3. What activity provided Nehemiah with a key source of strength,
            helping him to persist in the face of difficulty and adversity
            (Nehemiah 6:9)?
          </p>

        <section>
          <p>
            4. To whom does Nehemiah attribute the successfully rebuilt wall
            that resulted from his courageous stand (Nehemiah 6:16)?
          </p>
          <p>
            How critical was Nehemiah's reliance and dependence upon God to the
            level of courage he mustered?
