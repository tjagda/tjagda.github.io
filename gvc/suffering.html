              In contrast, how does the Bible describe the intentions of the
              enemy of God?

              The Bible describes one of God's angels, Lucifer, rising in
              rebellious pride against God and choosing evil rather than God's
              good way.

              Satan's momentous choice was the starting point of evil and the
              suffering that comes with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Sin</b> is the ultimate cause of suffering. And Satan wants
              nothing more than to thwart God's plan and destroy our trust in
              God's goodness.

              Satan has been deceiving humanity from the beginning, and he got
              Eve and Adam to mimic his own wrong choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              By choosing to decide for <u>themselves</u> what they thought was
              good and what they thought was evil, they were ignoring the only
              true source of that knowledge.

              Satan has helped us build a society that too often redefines sin
              as acceptable. But even when men don't realize something is wrong,
              it still brings the automatic consequences of suffering and death.

              Even though God gives us free will, does He tell us what choice He
              wants us to make?
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Deuteronomy 30:15-19</li>

              By giving us the chance to choose, God gives us the opportunity to
              develop His righteous character, something we couldn't develop if
              He always forced us to make the right choice.

              Since sin causes suffering, does that mean the person who is
              suffering is always responsible for his or her own suffering?
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Luke 13:2-5</li>

              Sadly, sins have consequences that often affect not just the
              sinner, but those around him or her as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a world that has told God to keep His hands off (Matt 23:37),
              Satan is pulling the strings, allowing trials and suffering to
              come on innocent victims and God's people as well.

              So we should never judge the victims of suffering, but should be
              aware of our personal responsibility to repent and turn to God.
