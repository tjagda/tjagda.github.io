            <h4>No, God even uses wealth to bless us</h4>
            <p class="verse">
              The blessing of the Lord makes one rich, and He adds no sorrow
              with it.

            <h4>However, loving money is dangerous</h4>
            <p class="verse">
              <sup>9</sup>But those who want to get rich fall into temptation
              and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge
              people into ruin and destruction. <sup>10</sup>For the
              <b>love of money</b> is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by
              longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced
              themselves with many griefs.

              No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and
              love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the
              other. You cannot serve God <b>and</b> wealth

            <p class="verse">
              <sup>21</sup>Looking at him, Jesus showed love to him and said to
              him, ‚ÄúOne thing you lack: go and sell all you possess and give to
              the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow
              Me.‚Äù <sup>22</sup>But he was deeply dismayed by these words, and
              he went away grieving; for he was one who owned much property.

              ‚ÄúHow hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the
              kingdom of God!‚Äù <sup>24</sup>And the disciples were amazed at His
              words. But Jesus responded again and said to them, ‚ÄúChildren, how
              hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! <sup>25</sup>It is easier
              for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
              person to enter the kingdom of God.‚Äù

              <sup>26</sup>And they were even more astonished, and said to Him,
              ‚ÄúThen who can be saved?‚Äù <sup>27</sup>Looking at them, Jesus said,
              ‚ÄúWith people it is impossible, but not with God; for all things
              are possible with God.‚Äù

              What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you
              Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are careful to tithe even the
              tiniest income from your herb gardens, but you ignore the more
              important aspects of the law‚Äîjustice, mercy, and faith. You should
              tithe, yes, but do not neglect the more important things.
