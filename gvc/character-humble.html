            “humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of
            yourself less.”

            However, we're naturally prone to place ourselves ahead of others
            because normally we care more about ourselves than we do others
          </p>
          <p class="fragment">
            Which means over time we develop an unhealthy sense of our own
            self-worth

            <b>Humility</b> is a state of mind. It's an <u>awareness</u> of
            where we really fit in the big picture of life. It's a realization
            that "I am" not the center of life… the world does not revolve
            around "me"
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            <b>Humility</b> is coming to terms with who we are
            <u>in the light</u> of who God is, and then “living out” that
            reality in our day to-day lives

            2. Who was more honest with God about where he fit in the big
            picture of life, the Pharisee or the tax collector?
          </p>
          <p class="fragment">
            Why was that individual able to see himself more accurately and
            clearly in God's estimation than the other individual?

        <section>

            Consider an aspect of life where you're prone to compare yourself
            favorably to others or consider yourself superior in any way.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment">
            How does that detract from your ability to relate to and connect
            with others in a positive way?
