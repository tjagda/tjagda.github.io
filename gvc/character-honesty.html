          <p>Most of us won't say that we are dishonest..</p>
          <p class="fragment">
            but if we're honest about our honesty, we've all told lies at some
            point in the past.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h4>What is honesty?</h4>
          <p>
            The definition of <u>honesty</u> is acting in a trustworthy way so
            that you will respect yourself and be respected by others.

          <h4>Why be honest?</h4>
          <p>
            Socially, people trust you more and will believe on what you are
            saying. They won't have to second guess and question your
            intentions.

        <section data-auto-animate="">
          <h4>Why be honest?</h4>
          <p>
            Mentally, you can live confidently in who you are and what you say.
            You won't have to worry about getting your lies in order because the
            truth will always stay the same.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section data-auto-animate="">
          <h4>Why be honest?</h4>
          <p>
            Spiritually, it's the right thing to do. Always living and speaking
            in truth will honor God and will be a good example for others.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h4>How to build honesty</h4>
          <p class="fragment">
            Being honest is about actions, words, and deeds that are always
            consistent with the truth. (Obviously easier said than done)

          <h4>1/5</h4>
          <p>
            Ananias and Sapphira had lethal consequences for their dishonesty,
            but is there ever a time when there are no consequences for being
            dishonest?
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>2/5</h4>
          <p>
            When we tell a lie, where does it come from (Acts&nbsp;5:3)? Does it
            mean that it's a deliberate choice on our part when we lie, cheat,
            or steal (Acts 5:2)?
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>3/5</h4>
          <p>
            While we can fool some of the people some of the time when we're
            dishonest, do we ever fool God with our dishonesty? What does
            dishonesty do to our relationship with God?

          <h3>Application</h3>
          <p>
            What is one area of your life where you are prone to exaggerate or
            maybe even mislead others?
          </p>
          <p>
            What possible motives did you have? Who possibly got hurt besides
            God when you are dishonest?
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            Whatever it may be, come to God with pure honesty in prayer and seek
            forgiveness and renewal.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment">
            1 John 1:9 assures us that God is ALWAYS “faithful to forgive us and
            to cleanse us from our sin.”
