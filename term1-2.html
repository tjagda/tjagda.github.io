                <p>
                    In my first two workterms, I worked as a <strong>Jr. QA/Web Developer</strong> at the head office of <a href="https://www.cooperators.ca/" target="_blank">The Co-operators</a>.<br/>
                    <br/> With their head office based in downtown Guelph, The Co-operators is a leading Canadian multi-product insurance and financial services organization. This company is very community driven with a lot of focus on the customer's experience. The environment is corporate but quite relaxed compared to most others.<br/>
                    <br/> The people at The Co-operators have been extremely welcoming and nice ever since day 1, and I've never felt like I didn't belong. Of course in my first few weeks, it was a little bit of a rocky start getting to know people, the workflow, mannerisms and such. But since the community in the workplace was so awesome, it didn't take that long to make good connections and good friends.<br/>
                    <br/> In general, I had a great experience in both QA and development which gave me insight as to how a career in either (in a corporate setting) will be like. What daily challenges I might face and what to look foward to or watch out for.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Although I did have prior experience in a corporate workplace from my co-op at Linamar, moving into a larger and more developed corporate environment meant learning and adapting more things that are prevalent in the real world.<br/>
                                                        <br/> It didn't take too much work to dress up and have the right manners, but doing it consistently every single day was the real challenge. It took a while to get used to, but I believe I managed to keep it up everyday from the feedback I got from my manager. It was a good thing though that very Friday was Casual Friday so I can get a break every once in while.

                                                    <p>
                                                        In my classes, the only languages I got to learn were mainly C, Java, and a bit of Python. So a goal I had for this work term was to learn a new and relevant technology that is used in the industry.<br/>
                                                        <br/> Since I was part web developer and part QA - where my QA role is based on the web services - it was pretty obvious that I should start picking up all the standard web technologies used today which were HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (along with their varients and frameworks).<br/>
                                                        <br/> To complete this goal, I had to go through a bunch of websites and tutorials in my own time and practice makings random websites and web apps. An example is when I created an Excel parser using JavaScript that proved useful for the QA team when formatting these specific Excel files were becoming too much of a hassle.
                                                    </p>

                                                        There were several points where I had free time and gave myself some work to do like learning web development or ask for some work around the office. It was at this point that a co-worker of mine gave an idea of developing a tool for the QA team to check broken links. This was a great opportunity for a devlopment and learning experience, so I made this as a goal.<br/>
                                                        <br/> Even though I quickly finished a decent version of the program, I still had to make it work well with other people that could be using it. I also had to make the program run faster and be able to run on secured sites. There were other features that I had to include which is described in more detail in the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-briefcase"></span> <strong>Job Description</strong> section.

                                    My job title at the Co-operators was Jr. QA/Web Developer. In this position I was split between the two teams and given several different roles in each them.<br/>
                                    <br/> In the QA team I was tasked to mainly fix defects sent by other members of the QA team on the new Online Services website that the Co-operators were starting up. This ranges from small text changes (usually a translation issue) to image issues in email headers. Other tasks include but not limited to doing the actual testing to find defects and making the Broken Link Checker (described below).<br/>
                                    <br/> In the web development team I had a different set of takss to do. I would do most of my work with their content management tool Sitecore. It took a while to get used to, but the interface was clear enough to get going right away. My main duties range from content changes on labels and descriptions to JavaScript changes to fix behavioral defects on the site.

                                <p>
                                    The biggest project I did during this co-op was the <a href="https://github.com/Qazmkl/Broken-Link-Checker" target="_blank">Broken Link Checker</a>. This was first just an idea given to me by a co-worker. He wasn't too sure if it was possible to implement a program that can check links, but I insisted that I could at least try since I have enough technical expertise in Java (from my first and second year courses).<br/>
                                    <br/> After Googling around and checking out Stack Overflow, I found that it was possible to make such a program through Java so I quickly implemented a small prototype. After showing it to my co-worker and manager, they were impressed enough to make this program a full project for me to do.<br/>
                                    <br/> The whole project took about the entirety of my second workterm. Building and testing features, making a GUI, making it usable and adding good documentation were only some of the things I had to do for this program to succeed. It was a good thing I had people to bounce ideas off with and people with great programming experience to show what a better solution could be.<br/>
                                    <br/> In the final months of my co-op, I actually got to use my program in this project where the web development team were making a new environment to test on. Some links could be brokne due to lack of abstraction in some pages, but since there can be so many pages in some sites (4000+), it would take the QA team more than half a month for that one site. Fortunately, with my Broken Link Checker I was able to scan each website in half an hour or less with only some behavioural tweaks here and there to improve running time, avoid crashes, and generate a more detailed output.<br/>
                                    <br/> Heading into my final week, I had to make sure that the program was documented and user-friendly for future use when I leave the company. It didn't take too long but I had to test with my co-workers to make sure that the program at least works with their computers since there had been issues in the past on Java compatibility. Looking back I see this as a great dev and QA experience since this program involved both of them. I got to see what it is like developing inside an actual company and working with professionals to give ideas on algorithms and program structure.

                                    After the whole 8 months working at The Co-operators, I am happy to say that it was a great experience to have (let alone start with) and I am very grateful for having them take me in. I have gained a good chunk of experience and knowledge in a career of both a QA and a Developer through working with them, observing what they do and just talking to them.<br/>
                                    <br/> I especially had a really good expereince when I started working on my Broken Link Checker. It wasn't much at first, but through several iterations, working with others, and actually getting value out of it when using it in a real project it was actually something I could be proud of. My team, my supervisor and even the directors of our teams commended me for my hard work, which pushed me further into making this program the best and most usuable I can make it for future use without me.<br/>
                                    <br/> The Broken Link Checker also gave me insight on the type of career I might want to head into. So for the next co-op work term I'll try to head for a development job and see what the full experience is like.
