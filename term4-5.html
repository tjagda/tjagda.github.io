                    In my final two workterms, I returned again to The Co-operators Innovation team in Kitchener. I
                    enjoyed the team and the environment so much from the summer before that I wanted to come back to
                    help continue building my skills within this team.<br>
                    <br>The first of the two terms I continued as a <strong>RPA Developer</strong>, but instead
                    working with a new project with a company under the Co-operators in Calgary called Sovereign. Their
                    processes that they wanted automated dealt with different applications I have experience so I found
                    it exciting that I get to work on something new even though it was still RPA.<br>
                    <br>The second term I initially worked on a project that dealt with MicroStrategy, a data analytics
                    and visualizations tool. I then moved on to assisting other co-ops in their projects whether it was
                    RPA or Artificial Intelligent Chatbots. By the end, I was working on th AI Chatbots full-time to
                    enhance one of our upcoming chatbot's features and polisihing it for testing.<br>
                    <br>In general, these final two terms were a great way to end off since it taught me new
                    technologies like NodeJS and also gave me the leadership role in teaching and mentoring new co-ops
                    as they come into their first co-op.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Working on a new project with a new set of product owners in
                                                        Sovereign General Insurance, I found that their processes
                                                        required bots in environments and applications I had no
                                                        experience with like unique web apps and automating terminals.
                                                        And since they were so different I knew it was gonna be a
                                                        challenge. Fortunately, with the help of some of my co-workers
                                                        and Google, I was able to finish developing all of their
                                                        initial requirements that used the new environments and
                                                        applications. And from the feedback from my product owner, I
                                                        did a great job automating those processes in the new
                                                        environemnts and applications.

                                                        and the REST API</h3>
                                                    <p>
                                                        One of the end goals for RPA in The Co-operators is that we
                                                        would use a tool called Orchestrator that will be the command
                                                        station for handling and scheduling all the different RPA bots
                                                        and processes. From the web app interface it is pretty simple
                                                        to use, however, in certain processes it is required to use the
                                                        REST API to function as per the requirements.<br>
                                                        <br>Initially I personally did not have much experience using
                                                        REST API and doing HTTP requests. But working through it with
                                                        my colleagues, we managed to learn make re-usable NodeJS
                                                        wrapper modules that later co-ops can use easily that uses the
                                                        Orchestrator REST API. Now this wrapper module is in the main

                                                        I found myself working with other co-ops who were having their
                                                        first co-op experience. So on top of doing my regular
                                                        responsibilities, I had to also teach and mentor the new co-op
                                                        students from things like how to use the Git source version
                                                        control to the basics of how to develop in UiPath. I found that
                                                        I was able to reach my goal when these same co-ops were able to
                                                        develop bots and programs easily without my help as well as

                                <p>
                                    I started the first term as a returning RPA Developer but for a new project and for
                                    a different team in the company. Unlike the processes I've done before, these ones
                                    mostly dealt with an old web app and terminals which were things I did not have
                                    much experience automating.<br>
                                    <br>Luckily there were helpful tutorials and features in
                                    UiPath that helped me solve some of the problems inherit in these new kinds of
                                    environments and applications. Overall, this term improved my general development
                                    skills and communcation skills to my product owners during demo presentations and
                                    sprint transitions.

                                <p>
                                    The second term, I switched into a new project that used a data analytics and
                                    visualization tool called MicroStrategy. I started learning how to create cloud
                                    instances for hosting MicroStrategy and how to create basic visualizations using
                                    public metrics and attributes.<br>
                                    <br>There were many times where I had to wait for
                                    certain permissions for MicroStrategy, so in the downtime I would go assist other
                                    projects in RPA or AI and create new custom modules for the Incubator like one that
                                    used NodeJS to make a wrapper that uses the UiPath Orchestrator REST API. By the
                                    end of the term I was working on AI chatbots full time and created several programs
                                    for the project like a html to json parser for a very old website databse and a
                                    custom search module that used keywords from a phrase and a point system to narrow
                                    down search results to what the user wanted to see.

                                    These final two workterms were a blast! In the beginning I wasn't sure if I
                                    made the right decision going back instead of trying out a new company with a new
                                    role but I was sorely mistaken. In both terms, I still was able to try something
                                    new or learn something new about something I already know about. I was also able to
                                    improve some of things that I used to struggle with like demo presentations.
                                    Overall, I was definitely happy I finished my final two workterms here at the
                                    Co-operators!

                                    I first would like to thank Ron Mooibroek for taking me back to another amazing
                                    opportunity to work with them and the Innovation Team for the Co-operators this
                                    past terms.<br>
                                    <br>I would also like to thank all my co-workers and colleagues for making
                                    both workterms so fun and energetic everyday. Lastly, I would like to
                                    acknowledge Katherine McRoberts, Laura Gatto, and all of the Co-operative
                                    Education & Career Services team on making sure that this workterm would go as
                                    smoothly as possible.
