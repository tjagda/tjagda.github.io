        <h3>Old Testament Kingdoms</h3>
        <p>Very early on in the Bible, God planned for Israel to lead this new kingdom:</p>
        <div class="verse-block">
          <p class="verse">
            So now then, if you will indeed listen to My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My treasured
            possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine; and you shall be to Me a <u>kingdom of priests
              and a holy nation.</u> ’ These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel.”
          </p>
          <p class="verse-citation">Exodus 19:5-6</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>But they were unable to keep this covenant...</p>

      <section data-auto-animate>
        <h3>Old Testament Kingdoms</h3>
        <p>
          They wanted to be an earthly kingdom with an earthly king and eventually fell into the earthly ways of other
          nations.
        </p>
        <p>
          After many warnings and chances to repent, God finally handed them over to the Babylonians:
        </p>
        <div class="verse-block">
          <p class="verse">
            And you, O slain, wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the
            end,’ thus says the LORD, ‘Remove the turban and take off the crown; this <em>will </em>no longer <em>be
            </em>the same.
          </p>
          <p class="verse">
            Make high that which is low and make low that which is high. A ruin, a ruin, a ruin, I will
            make it. This also will be no more until He comes to whom the <em>legal </em>judgment belongs, and I will
            give it <em>to Him</em>.’
          </p>

        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
          But God still promises to continue this kingdom but under someone else who was worthy.
