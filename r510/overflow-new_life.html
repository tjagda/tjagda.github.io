        <p class="verse">
          And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all He has done for
          you. Let them be a <b>living and holy sacrifice</b>—the kind He will find acceptable. This is truly the way to
          worship Him.
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
          Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, <b>but let God transform you</b> into a new person by
          changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and
          perfect.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="verse">
          Because of the privilege and authority God has given me, I give each of you this warning: <b>Don’t think you
            are better than you really are.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
          Be honest in your evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us.
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
          Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function, so it is with Christ’s body. <b>We
            are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other.</b>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="verse">
          In His grace, <b>God has given us different gifts</b> for doing certain things well.
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
          So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith as God has given you. If your
          gift is serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, teach well.
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
          If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. If it is giving, give generously. If God has given you
          leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others,
          do it gladly.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
          Don’t just pretend to love others. Really <b>love</b> them.
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
          Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good.
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
          Love each other with genuine affection, and take delight in honoring each other.
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
          Never be lazy, but work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically.
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
          Rejoice in our confident hope. Be patient in trouble, and keep on praying.
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
          When God’s people are in need, be ready to help them. Always be eager to practice hospitality.
