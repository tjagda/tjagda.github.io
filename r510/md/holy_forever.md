### Holy Forever <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->

A thousand generations

Falling  down in worship

To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
---
And all who've gone before us

And all who will believe

Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
---
Your name is the highest

Your name is the greatest

Your name stands above them all
---
All thrones and dominions

All powers and positions

Your name stands above them all
---
And the angels cry

If you've been forgiven

And if you've been redeemed

Sing the song forever to the Lamb
---
If you walk in freedom

And if you bear His name

Sing the song forever to the Lamb
---
We'll sing the song forever and amen
---
And the angels cry
