### My Lighthouse <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
In my wrestling and in my doubts

In my failures You won't walk out

Your great love will lead me through
---
You are the peace in my trouble sea

You are the peace in my trouble sea
---
In the silence You won't let go

In the questions Your truth will hold

Your great love will lead me through
---
You are the peace in my trouble sea

You are the peace in my trouble sea
---
My lighthouse, my lighthouse

Shining in the darkness

I will follow You
---
My lighthouse, my lighthouse

I will trust the promise

You will carry me
---
Safe to shore-woah-woah

Safe to shore-woah-woah

Safe to shore-woah-woah

Safe to shore
---
I won't fear what tomorrow brings

With each morning I'll rise and sing

My God's love will lead me through
---
You are the peace in my trouble sea

You are the peace in my trouble sea
---
My lighthouse, my lighthouse

Shining in the darkness

I will follow You
---
My lighthouse, my lighthouse

I will trust the promise

You will carry me
---
Safe to shore-woah-woah

Safe to shore-woah-woah

Safe to shore-woah-woah

Safe to shore
---
Fire before us

You're the brightest

You will lead us through the storms
---
Fire before us

You're the brightest

You will lead us through the storms
---
Fire before us

You're the brightest

You will lead us through the storms
---
Fire before us

You're the brightest

You will lead us through the storms
---
My lighthouse, my lighthouse

Shining in the darkness

I will follow You
---
My lighthouse, my lighthouse

I will trust the promise

You will carry me
---
Safe to shore-woah-woah

Safe to shore-woah-woah

Safe to shore-woah-woah

Safe to shore
