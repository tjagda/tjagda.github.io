### Unstoppable God <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
Heaven thundered

And the world was born
---
Life begins and ends

In the dust You formed
---
Faith commanded

And the mountains moved
---
Fear is losing ground

To our hope in You
---
Unstoppable God

Let Your glory go on and on
---
Impossible things

In Your name they shall be done
---
Freedom conquered

All our chains undone
---
Sin defeated

Jesus has overcome
---
Mercy triumphed

When the third day dawned
---
Darkness was denied

When the stone was gone
---
Unstoppable God

Let Your glory go on and on
---
Impossible things

In Your name they shall be done
---
Unstoppable God

Let Your glory go on and on
---
Impossible things

In Your name they shall be done
---
Nothing shall be impossible

Your kingdom reigns unstoppable
---
We'll shout Your praise forevermore

Jesus our God unstoppable
---
Nothing shall be impossible

Your kingdom reigns unstoppable
---
We'll shout Your praise forevermore

Jesus our God unstoppable
---
Nothing shall be impossible

Your kingdom reigns unstoppable
---
We'll shout Your praise forevermore

Jesus our God unstoppable
---
Nothing shall be impossible

Your kingdom reigns unstoppable
---
We'll shout Your praise forevermore

Jesus our God unstoppable
---
Unstoppable God

Let Your glory go on and on
---
Impossible things

In Your name they shall be done
---
Unstoppable God

Let Your glory go on and on
---
Impossible things

In Your name they shall be done
