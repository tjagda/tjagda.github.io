### Christ Be Magnified <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
Were creation suddenly articulate                           

With a thousand tongues to lift one cry
---
Then from North to South and East to West

We'd hear 'Christ be magnified!'
---
Were the whole earth echoing His eminence

His name would burst from sea and sky
---
From rivers to the mountain tops                

We'd hear 'Christ be magnified!'
---
O! Christ be magnified!

Let His praise arise

Christ be magnified in me
---
O! Christ be magnified!

From the altar of my life

Christ be magnified in me
---
When every creature finds its inmost melody              

And every human heart its native cry
---
O then in one enraptured hymn of praise             

We'll sing 'Christ be magnified!'
---
O! Christ be magnified!

Let His praise arise

Christ be magnified in me
---
O! Christ be magnified!

From the altar of my life

Christ be magnified in me
---
I won't bow to idols 

I'll stand strong and worship You 
---
And if it puts me in the fire

I'll rejoice 'cause You're there too
---
I won't be formed by feelings

I hold fast to what is true
---
If the cross brings transformation 

Then I'll be crucified with You
---
'Cause death is just the doorway

Into resurrection life
---
And if I join You in Your suffering 

Then I'll join You when You rise
---
And when You return in glory 

With all the angels and the saints 
---
My heart will still be singing

And my song will be the same
---
O! Christ be magnified!

Let His praise arise

Christ be magnified in me
---
O! Christ be magnified!

From the altar of my life

Christ be magnified in me
---
O! Christ be magnified!

Let His praise arise

Christ be magnified in me
---
O! Christ be magnified!

From the altar of my life

Christ be magnified in me
---
