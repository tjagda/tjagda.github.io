### Death was Arrested <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
Alone in my sorrow and dead in my sin

Lost without hope and no place to begin 
---
Your love made a way to let mercy come in 

When death was arrested and my life began
---
Ash was redeemed only beauty remains

And my orphan heart was given a name
---
My mourning grew quiet, my feet rose to dance

When death was arrested and my life began
---
Oh Your grace so free washes over me

You have made me new, now life begins with You
---
It’s Your endless love pouring down on us

You have made us new now life begins with You
---
Released from my chain, I’m a prisoner no more

My shame was a ransom He faithfully bore
---
He cancelled my debt and He called me His friend

When death was arrested and my life began
---
Oh Your grace so free washes over me

You have made me new, now life begins with You
---
It’s Your endless love pouring down on us

You have made us new now life begins with You
---
Our Saviour displayed on a criminal’s cross

And darkness rejoiced as though 

Heaven had lost
---
But then Jesus arose with our freedom in hand

That’s when death was arrested 

And my life began
---
Oh Your grace so free washes over me

You have made me new, now life begins with You
---
It’s Your endless love pouring down on us

You have made us new now life begins with You
---
Oh we’re free, free, forever we’re free

Come join the song of all the redeemed
---
Yes, we’re free, free, forever amen

When death was arrested and my life began
---
Oh we’re free, free, forever we’re free

Come join the song of all the redeemed
---
Yes, we’re free, free, forever amen

When death was arrested and my life began
---
When death was arrested and my life began

That’s when death was arrested

And my life began
---
