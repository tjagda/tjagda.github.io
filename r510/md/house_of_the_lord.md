### House of the Lord <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
We worship the God who was

We worship the God who is

We worship the God who evermore will be
---
He opened the prison doors

He parted the raging sea

My God, He holds the victory
---
There’s joy in the house of the Lord

There’s joy in the house of the Lord today
---
And we won’t be quiet

We shout out Your praise
---
There’s joy in the house of the Lord

Our God is surely in this place
---
And we won’t be quiet

We shout out Your praise
---
We sing to the God who heals

We sing to the God who saves

We sing to the God who always makes a way
---
'Cause He hung upon that cross

Then He rose up from that grave

My God’s still rolling stones away
---
There’s joy in the house of the Lord

There’s joy in the house of the Lord today
---
And we won’t be quiet

We shout out Your praise
---
There’s joy in the house of the Lord

Our God is surely in this place
---
And we won’t be quiet

We shout out Your praise
---
(Oh-oh-oh)

We shout out Your praise
---
We were the beggars

Now we're royalty
---
We were the prisoners

Now we're running free
---
We are forgiven, accepted,

Redeemed by His grace
---
Let the house of the Lord sing praise
---
We were the beggars

Now we're royalty
---
We were the prisoners

Now we're running free
---
We are forgiven, accepted,

Redeemed by His grace
---
Let the house of the Lord sing praise
---
There’s joy in the house of the Lord

There’s joy in the house of the Lord today
---
And we won’t be quiet

We shout out Your praise
---
There’s joy in the house of the Lord

Our God is surely in this place

And wе won’t be quiet

We shout out Your praise
---
There’s joy in the house of the Lord

There’s joy in the house of the Lord today
---
And we won’t be quiet

We shout out Your praise
---
There’s joy in the house of the Lord

Our God is surely in this place
---
And wе won’t be quiet

We shout out Your praise
---
(Oh-oh-oh)

We shout out Your praise
---
We shout out Your praise
