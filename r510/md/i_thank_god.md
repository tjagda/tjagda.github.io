### I Thank God <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
Wandering into the night

Wanting a place to hide

This weary soul, this bag of
bones
---
And I tried with all my might

But I just can't win the fight

I'm slowly drifting, a vagabond
---
And just when I ran out of road

I met a man I didn't know

And He told me that I was not alone
---
He picked me up

He turned me around

He placed my feet on solid
ground
---
I thank the Master

I thank the Savior
---
Because He healed my heart

He changed my name

Forever free, I'm not the same
---
I thank the Master

I thank the Savior

I thank God
---
I cannot dеny what I see

Got no choice but to believе

My doubts are burning

Like ashes in the wind
---
So, so long to my old friends

Burden and bitterness

You can just keep it moving

Nah, you ain't welcome here
---
From now 'til I walk the
streets of gold

I'll sing of how you saved my
soul

This wayward son has found his
way back home
---
He picked me up

He turned me around

He placed my feet on solid
ground
---
I thank the Master

I thank the Savior
---
Because He healed my heart

He changed my name

Forever free, I'm not the same
---
I thank the Master

I thank the Savior

I thank God
---
Hell lost another one

I am free, I am free, I am free

Hell lost another one

I am free, I am free, I am free
---
Hell lost another one

I am free, I am free, I am free

Hell lost another one

I am free, I am free, I am free
---
Hell lost another one

I am free, I am free, I am free

Hell lost another one

I am free, I am free, I am free
---
Hell lost another one

I am free, I am free, I am free

Hell lost another one

I am free, I am free, I am free
---
He picked me up

He turned me around

He placed my feet on solid
ground
---
I thank the Master

I thank the Savior
---
Because He healed my heart

He changed my name

Forever free, I'm not the same
---
I thank the Master

I thank the Savior

I thank God
---
