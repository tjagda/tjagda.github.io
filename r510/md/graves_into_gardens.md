### Graves into Gardens <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
I searched the world

But it couldn't fill me
---
Man's empty praise

And treasures that fade

Are never enough
---
Then You came along

And put me back together
---
And every desire

Is now satisfied

Here in Your love
---
Oh, there's nothing better than You

There's nothing better than You
---
Lord, there's nothing

Nothing is better than You
---
I'm not afraid

To show You my weakness
---
My failures and flaws

Lord, You've seen them all

And You still call me friend
---
Cause the God of the mountain

Is the God of the valley
---
There's not a place

Your mercy and grace

Won't find me again
---
Oh, there's nothing better than You

There's nothing better than You
---
Lord, there's nothing

Nothing is better than You
---
Oh, there's nothing better than You

There's nothing better than You
---
Lord, there's nothing

Nothing is better than You
---
You turn mourning to dancing

You give beauty for ashes
---
You turn shame into glory

You're the only one who can
---
You turn mourning to dancing

You give beauty for ashes
---
You turn shame into glory

You're the only one who can
---
You turn graves into gardens

You turn bones into armies

You turn seas into highways
---
You're the only one who can

You're the only one who can
---
Oh, there's nothing better than You

There's nothing better than You
---
Lord, there's nothing

Nothing is better than You
---
Oh, there's nothing better than You

There's nothing better than You
---
Lord, there's nothing

Nothing is better than You
---
You turn graves into gardens

You turn bones into armies

You turn seas into highways
---
You're the only one who can

You're the only one who can

You're the only one who can
---
