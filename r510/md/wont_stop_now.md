I give you glory

For all You've brought me through

And now I'm ready

For whatever You wanna do
---
I'm moving forward

To follow after You

And now I'm ready

For whatever You wanna do
---
Your presence is an open door

We want You, Lord

Like never before
---
Your presence is an open door

So come now, Lord

Like never before
---
In every season

You grace has been enough

And I'm believing

The best is yet to come
---
The cross before me

My hope on things above

And in You, Jesus

The best is yet to come
---
Your presence is an open door

We want You, Lord

Like never before
---
Your presence is an open door

So come now, Lord

Like never before

I know breakthrough is coming

By faith I see a miracle

My God made me a promise

And it won't stop now

I know breakthrough is coming

By faith I see a miracle

My God made me a promise

And it won't stop now

I know breakthrough is coming

By faith I see a miracle

My God made me a promise

And it won't stop now
