### O Come to the Altar <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
Are you hurting and broken within?

Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?

Jesus is calling
---
Have you come to the end of yourself?

Do you thirst for a drink from the well?

Jesus is calling
---
O come to, the altar

The Father's arms are open wide
---
Forgiveness, was bought with

The precious blood of Jesus Christ
---
Leave behind your regrets and mistakes

Come today thereâ€™s no reason to wait

Jesus is calling
---
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy

From the ashes a new life is born

Jesus is calling
---
O come to, the altar

The Father's arms are open wide
---
Forgiveness, was bought with

the precious blood of Jesus Christ
---
O come to, the altar

The Father's arms are open wide
---
Forgiveness, was bought with

the precious blood of Jesus Christ
---
Oh what a Saviour

Isn't He wonderful

Sing hallelujah Christ is risen
---
Bow down before Him

For He is Lord of all

Sing hallelujah Christ is risen
---
O come to, the altar

The Father's arms are open wide
---
Forgiveness, was bought with

The precious blood of Jesus Christ
---
O come to, the altar

The Father's arms are open wide
---
Forgiveness, was bought with

The precious blood of Jesus Christ
---
Bear your cross as you wait for the crown

Tell the world of the treasure you found
---
Bear your cross as you wait for the crown

Tell the world of the treasure you found
---
