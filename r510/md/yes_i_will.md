### Yes I Will <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
I count on one thing

The same God that never fails
---
Will not fail me now

You won't fail me now
---
In the waiting

The same God who's never late
---
Is workin' all things out

You're workin' all things out
---
Yes I will

Lift You high in the lowest valley
---
Yes I will

Bless Your name
---
Oh, yes I will

Sing for joy

When my heart is heavy
---
All my days

Oh yes I will
---
I count on one thing

The same God that never fails
---
Will not fail me now

You won't fail me now
---
In the waiting

The same God who's never late
---
Is workin' all things out

You're workin' all things out
---
Yes I will

Lift You high in the lowest valley
---
Yes I will

Bless Your name
---
Oh, yes I will

Sing for joy

When my heart is heavy
---
All my days

Oh yes I will
---
All my days

Oh yes I will
---
And I choose to praise

To glorify, to glorify
---
The Name of all names

That nothing can stand against
---
And I choose to praise

To glorify, to glorify
---
The Name of all names

That nothing can stand against
---
And I choose to praise

To glorify, to glorify
---
The Name of all names

That nothing can stand against
---
And I choose to praise

To glorify, to glorify
---
The Name of all names

That nothing can stand against
---
Yes I will

Lift You high in the lowest valley
---
Yes I will

Bless Your name
---
Oh, yes I will

Sing for joy

When my heart is heavy
---
All my days

Oh yes I will
---
For all my days

Oh yes I will
---
For all my days

Oh yes I will
