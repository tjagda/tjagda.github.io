God of Abraham

You’re the God of covenant

And faithful promises
---
Time and time again

You have proven

You’ll do just what you said
---
Though the storms may come

And the winds may blow

I’ll remain steadfast
---
And let my heart learn

When you speak a word

It will come to pass
---
Great is your faithfulness to me

Great is your faithfulness to me
---
God from age to age

Though the earth may pass away

Your Word remains the same
---
Your history can prove

There’s nothing you can’t do

You’re faithful and true
---
Though the storms may come

And the winds may blow

I’ll remain steadfast
---
And let my heart learn

When you speak a word

It will come to pass
---
Great is your faithfulness to me

Great is your faithfulness to me
---
From the rising sun

To the setting same

I will praise your name

Great is your faithfulness to me
---
I put my faith in Jesus

My anchor to the ground
---
My hope and firm foundation

He’ll never let me down
---
I put my faith in Jesus

My anchor to the ground
---
My hope and firm foundation

He’ll never let me down
---
I put my faith in Jesus

My anchor to the ground
---
My hope and firm foundation

He’ll never let me down
---
I put my faith in Jesus

My anchor to the ground
---
My hope and firm foundation

He’ll never let me down

He’ll never let me down
---
Great is your faithfulness to me

Great is your faithfulness to me
---
From the rising sun

To the setting same

I will praise your name

Great is your faithfulness to me
