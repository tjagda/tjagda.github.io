### So Will I <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
God of creation

There at the start

Before the beginning of time
---
With no point of reference

You spoke to the dark

And fleshed out the wonder of light
---
And as You speak

A hundred billion galaxies are born

In the vapor of Your breath the planets form
---
If the stars were made to worship

So will I
---
I can see Your heart

In everything You've made
---
Every burning star

A signal fire of grace
---
If creation sings Your praises

So will I
---
God of Your promise

You don't speak in vain

No syllable empty or void
---
For once You have spoken

All nature and science

Follow the sound of Your voice
---
And as You speak

A hundred billion creatures

Catch Your breath
---
Evolving in pursuit of

What You said
---
If it all reveals Your nature

So will I
---
I can see Your heart

In everything You say
---
Every painted sky

A canvas of Your grace
---
If creation still obeys You

So will I
---
So will I

So will I
---
If the stars were made to worship

So will I
---
If the mountains bow in reverence

So will I
---
If the oceans roar Your greatness

So will I
---
For if everything exists

To lift You high

So will I
---
If the wind goes where You send it

So will I
---
If the rocks cry out in silence

So will I
---
If the sum of all our praises

Still falls shy
---
Then we'll sing again

A hundred billion times
---
God of salvation

You chased down my heart

Through all of my failure and pride
---
On a hill You created

The light of the world

Abandoned in darkness to die
---
And as You speak

A hundred billion failures disappear
---
Where You lost Your life

So I could find it here
---
If You left the grave behind You

So will I
---
I can see Your heart

In everything You've done
---
Every part designed

In a work of art called love
---
If You gladly chose surrender

So will I
---
I can see Your heart

Eight billion different ways
---
Every precious one

A child You died to save
---
If You gave Your life to love them

So will I
---
Like You would again

A hundred billion times
---
But what measure could amount

To Your desire
---
You're the One who never leaves

The one behind
---
