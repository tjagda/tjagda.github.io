### Sing His Praise Again <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
Oh the weight of His glory,

Oh the wonder of His grace
---
The power of salvation

That pulled me from the grave
---
This hope is not empty 

And forever He will reign

He won’t be put to shame
---
Oh my soul, sing to the God of the ages

Sing to the Lord of creation

Sing His praise again
---
Oh my soul sing like the heavens are waiting

Roar like an army of angels

Sing His praise again
---
From the moment of rescue 

I have never been the same
---
When His love took me captive

And my sin was washed away
---
Now I stand here forgiven

And I know that I am saved

I won’t be put to shame
---
Oh my soul, sing to the God of the ages

Sing to the Lord of creation

Sing His praise again
---
Oh my soul sing like the heavens are waiting

Roar like an army of angels

Sing His praise again
---
Remember how our God

Has never failed, never failed us
---
Remember that His name

Will make way, He’ll make a way
---
From the cross, to the grave

He is risen and He reigns

Praise the Lord, and sing His praise again
---
Remember how our God

Has never failed, never failed us
---
Remember that His name

Will make way, He’ll make a way
---
From the cross, to the grave

He is risen and He reigns

Praise the Lord, and sing His praise again
---
Oh my soul, sing to the God of the ages

Sing to the Lord of creation

Sing His praise again
---
Oh my soul, sing like the heavens are waiting

Roar like an army of angels

Sing His praise again
---
Oh my soul, sing to the God of the ages

Sing to the Lord of creation

Sing His praise again
---
Oh my soul, sing like the heavens are waiting

Roar like an army of angels

Sing His praise again
---
Oh sing His praise again

Oh - oh - oh
---
Oh sing His praise again

Oh - oh - oh
---
Oh sing His praise again
