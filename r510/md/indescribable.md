### Indescribable <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
From the highest of heights

To the depths of the sea
---
Creation's revealing

Your majesty
---
From the colors of fall

To the fragrance of spring
---
Every creature unique

In the song that it sings
---
All exclaiming
---
Indescribable

Uncontainable
---
You placed the stars in the sky

And You know them by name

You are amazing God
---
All powerful

Untameable
---
Awestruck we fall to our knees

As we humbly proclaim

You are amazing God
---
Who has told every lightning bolt

Where it should go
---
Or seen heavenly storehouses

Laden with snow
---
Who imagined the sun

And gives source to its light
---
Yet conceals it to bring us

The coolness of night
---
None can fathom
---
Indescribable

Uncontainable
---
You placed the stars in the sky

And You know them by name

You are amazing God
---
All powerful

Untameable
---
Awestruck we fall to our knees

As we humbly proclaim
---
You are amazing God

You are amazing God
---
Indescribable

Uncontainable
---
You placed the stars in the sky

And You know them by name

You are amazing God
---
All powerful

Untameable
---
Awestruck we fall to our knees

As we humbly proclaim

You are amazing God
---
Indescribable

Uncontainable
---
You placed the stars in the sky

And You know them by name

You are amazing God
---
Incomparable

Unchangeable
---
You see the depths of my heart

And You love me the same
---
You are amazing God

You are amazing God
---
