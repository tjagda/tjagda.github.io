### Goodness of God <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
I love you, Lord

For your mercy never fails me

All my days, I’ve been held in your hands
---
From the moment that I wake up

Until I lay my head

I will sing of the goodness of
God
---
All my life you have been faithful

All my life you have been so, so good
---
With every breath that I am able

I will sing of the goodness of God
---
I love your voice

You have led me through the
fire
---
In darkest night

you are close like no other
---
I’ve known you as a father

I’ve known you as a friend

I have lived in the goodness of
God
---
All my life you have been faithful

All my life you have been so, so good
---
With every breath that I am able

I will sing of the goodness of God
---
Your goodness is running after,

It’s running after me

Your goodness is running after,

It’s running after me
---
With my life laid down,

I’m surrendered now

I give you everything
---
Your goodness is running after,

It’s running after me
---
Your goodness is running after,

It’s running after me

Your goodness is running after,

It’s running after me
---
With my life laid down,

I’m surrendered now

I give you everything
---
Your goodness is running after,

It’s running after me
---
All my life you have been faithful

All my life you have been so, so good
---
With every breath that I am able

I will sing of the goodness of God
---
All my life you have been faithful

All my life you have been so, so good
---
With every breath that I am able

I will sing of the goodness of God
---
I will sing of the goodness of
God
