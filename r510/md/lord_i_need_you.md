### Lord I Need You <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
Lord, I come, I confess

Bowing here, I find my rest
---
Without you I fall apart

You’re the one that guides my heart
---
Lord, I need you

Oh I need you

Every hour I need you
---
My one defense, my righteousness

Oh God, how I need you
---
Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more

Where grace is found, is where you are
---
And where you are, Lord I am free

Holiness is Christ in me
---
Lord, I need you

Oh I need you

Every hour I need you
---
My one defense, my righteousness

Oh God, how I need you
---
Teach my song to rise to you

When temptation comes my way
---
And when I cannot stand I’ll fall on you

Jesus, you’re my hope and stay
---
Teach my song to rise to you

When temptation comes my way
---
And when I cannot stand I’ll fall on you

Jesus, you’re my hope and stay
---
Lord, I need you

Oh I need you

Every hour I need you
---
My one defense, my righteousness

Oh God, how I need you
---
Lord, I need you

Oh I need you

Every hour I need you
---
My one defense, my righteousness

Oh God, how I need you
---
My one defense, my righteousness

Oh God, how I need you
---
