### Raise a Hallelujah <!-- .element: class="lyrics" -->
---
I raise a Hallelujah

In the presence of my enemies

I raise a Hallelujah

Louder than the unbelief
---
I raise a Hallelujah

My weapon is a melody

I raise a Hallelujah

Heaven comes to fight for me
---
I’m gonna sing

In the middle of the storm

Louder and louder

You’re gonna hear my praises roar
---
Up from the ashes

Hope will arise

Death is defeated

The king is alive
---
I raise a Hallelujah

With everything inside of me

I raise a Hallelujah

I will watch the darkness flee
---
I raise a Hallelujah

In the middle of the mystery

I raise a Hallelujah

Fear you lost your hold on me
---
I’m gonna sing

In the middle of the storm

Louder and louder

You’re gonna hear my praises roar
---
Up from the ashes

Hope will arise

Death is defeated

The king is alive
---
Sing a little louder

Sing a little louder

Sing a little louder

Sing a little louder
---
Sing a little louder

Sing a little louder

Sing a little louder

Sing a little louder
---
Sing a little louder

In the presence of my enemies

Sing a little louder

Louder than the unbelief
---
Sing a little louder

My weapon is a melody

Sing a little louder

Heaven comes to fight for me

Sing a little louder
---
I’m gonna sing

In the middle of the storm

Louder and louder

You’re gonna hear my praises roar
---
Up from the ashes

Hope will arise

Death is defeated

The king is alive
---
I’m gonna sing

In the middle of the storm

Louder and louder

You’re gonna hear my praises roar
---
Up from the ashes

Hope will arise

Death is defeated

The king is alive
---
I raise a Hallelujah

I raise a Hallelujah

I raise a Hallelujah

I raise a Hallelujah
---
I raise a Hallelujah

I raise a Hallelujah

I raise a Hallelujah

I raise a Hallelujah
---
I raise a Hallelujah

In the presence of my enemies

I raise a Hallelujah

Louder than the unbelief
---
I raise a Hallelujah

My weapon is a melody

I raise a Hallelujah

Heaven comes to fight for me
