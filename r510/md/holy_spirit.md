There's nothing worth more

that will ever come close

Nothing can compare, You're our living hope

Your Presence Lord

I've tasted and seen, of the sweetest of Loves

Where my heart becomes free, 
---
And my shame is undone

In Your Presence Lord

Holy Spirit You are welcome here                            

Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere

Your Glory God is what our hearts long for 

To be overcome by Your Presence Lord

There's nothing worth more

that will ever come close

Nothing can compare, You're our living hope

Your Presence Lord
